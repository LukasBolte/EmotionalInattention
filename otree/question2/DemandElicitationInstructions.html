    You will next decide whether you want to complete the Collaborative Job if Part 1 is chosen for payment. 
</p>

<p>
    On the next page, you will see a table like the one below. In the {{C.NUM_DEMAND_ELICITATION_QUESTIONS}} questions, you will decide whether you prefer (i) to complete the Collaborative Job, or (ii) get or pay a sure amount of money and not complete the Job. 
</p>

<div class="container pb-3">
    <div class="row justify-content-md-center">
        <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-10 ">
            <div class="img-container">
                <img src="{% static 'img/mpl_screenshot.jpg' %}"  alt="Table with questions" class="img-fluid mpl_img">
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    If Part 1 is chosen for payment, we will <b>randomly pick one of the questions and implement whatever you decided</b>, so choose wisely!
</p>

<p>
    So that you don't have to click on every row separately, you <i>only need to choose the row in which you want to <b>switch from getting/paying a sure amount of money to completing the Collaborative Job</b></i>. This will tell us how much you like the Job.
</p>

<p>
    Please, make your selection by dragging your mouse over the table and clicking on the corresponding row.
