    We have collected your answers and randomly chosen which part of the experiment will be used to determine your additional payment.
</p>

{{ if participant.part_payment == 'Part 1'}}

    <p>
        <b>Part 1 was randomly chosen for payment</b>. This means that you will get ${{C.BALANCE}} in addition to your participation fee of ${{ C.PARTICIPATION_FEE}}.
    </p>

    <p>
        During Part 1, we asked you several questions where you had to choose between completing the Collaborative Job and getting/paying some money. The question randomly chosen is:
    </p>

    <p class="text-center">
        <i>
            {{ participant.question }}
        </i>
    </p>

    {{ if participant.collaborative_job }}
        <p>
            For this question, you chose <b>complete the Collaborative Job</b>. Thus you will next complete the Collaborative Job. Once you complete it, you will receive your participation fee of ${{ C.PARTICIPATION_FEE}}, your balance of ${{ C.BALANCE }}, and the bonus minus the penalty from the Collaborative Job.
        </p>
        
    {{ else }}
        <p>
            For this question, you chose {{ right_option }}. {{ payment_text}}
        </p>

    {{ endif }}

{{ else }}

<p>
    <b>Part 2</b> was randomly chosen for payment. This means that you will not complete the Collaborative Job. But you will receive a payment of ${{C.PAYMENT_PART_2}} for completing Part 2 in addition to your participation fee of ${{ C.PARTICIPATION_FEE}}.
</p>

{{ endif }}

<button style="float: right" class="btn btn-primary btn-large">Next</button>
