<p>
    While you work on the bonus task, the computer will complete the <b>penalty task</b>. 
</p>

<p>
    In the <b>penalty task</b>, the computer starts with a <b>tentative penalty</b> of ${{ C.END_VALUE }}. It will then open {{ C.NUM_FORCED_OPEN }} boxes. Each time it opens a box, it will wait {{ C.DELAY }} seconds to reveal the penalty inside. One of two things can happen to the computer's tentative penalty after it opens a box:

    <ol>
        <li>If the penalty inside the box is <b>larger</b> than its tentative penalty, <b>its tentative penalty will stay the same</b>.</li>
        <li>If the penalty inside the box is <b>smaller</b> than its tentative penalty, <b>the penalty inside the box will become its new tentative penalty</b>.</li>
    </ol>  
    
    After the computer opens all {{ C.NUM_FORCED_OPEN }} boxes, the computer's <b>final tentative penalty will be taken away from your payment</b> from Part 1.
