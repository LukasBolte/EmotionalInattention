    While you work on the bonus task, the computer will complete a penalty task. 

    In the penalty task, the computer starts with a tentative penalty of $10. It will then open XX boxes. Each time it opens a box, it will wait 10 seconds to reveal the penalty inside. Two things can happen to the computerâ€™s tentative penalty after it opens a box:

    1.	If the penalty inside the box is larger than its tentative penalty, its tentative penalty stays the same.
    2.	If the penalty inside the box is smaller than its tentative penalty, the penalty inside the box becomes its new tentative penalty.

    After the computer opens all XX boxes, the tentative penalty will be taken away from your payment from Part I.
