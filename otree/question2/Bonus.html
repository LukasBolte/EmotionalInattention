    In the <b>bonus task</b>, you start with a <b>tentative bonus</b> of ${{ C.START_VALUE }}. You will then open {{ C.NUM_FORCED_OPEN }} boxes. Each time you open a box, you will wait {{ C.DELAY }} seconds to reveal the bonus inside. One of two things can happen to your tentative bonus after you open a box:

    <ol>
        <li>If the bonus inside the box is <b>smaller</b> than your tentative bonus, <b>your tentative bonus will stay the same</b>.</li>
        <li>If the bonus inside the box is <b>larger</b> than your tentative bonus, <b>the bonus inside the box will become your new tentative bonus</b>.</li>
    </ol>  
    
    After you open all {{ C.NUM_FORCED_OPEN }} boxes, the <b>final tentative bonus will be added to your payment</b> from Part 1.
