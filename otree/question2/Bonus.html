    In the bonus task, you start with a tentative bonus of $2. You will then open XX boxes. Each time you open a box, you will wait 10 seconds to reveal the bonus inside. Two things can happen to your tentative payment after you open a box:


    1.	If the bonus inside the box is smaller than your tentative bonus, your tentative bonus stays the same.
    2.	If the bonus inside the box is larger than your tentative bonus, the bonus inside the box becomes your new tentative bonus.

    After you open all XX boxes, the tentative bonus will be added to your payment from this experiment.
