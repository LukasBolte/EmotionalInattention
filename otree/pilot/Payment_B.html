    This study consists of one main task which determines your payment as follows. You start with a payment of ${{ C.MIN_PAY }}. And you can increase the payment by opening boxes. Each box contains an unknown dollar amount between ${{ C.MIN_PAY }} and ${{ C.MAX_PAY }}.
</p>

<p>
    There are {{ C.NUM_BOXES }} boxes overall. Don't worry, you do not have to open all of them! The following figure shows you how many of these boxes contain each dollar amount between ${{ C.MIN_PAY }} and ${{ C.MAX_PAY }}.
</p>

<p>
    Figure of Boxes. 
    A simple distribution could be uniform with 1ct increments. Or with a fait right tail.]  
</p>

<p>
    You will see these {{ C.NUM_BOXES }} boxes in random order. Each time you see a new box, you will decide whether you want to open it or end the task.
</p>
 
<p>
    If you open the box, the dollar amount inside will be revealed after a delay of {{ C.DELAY }} seconds. 
</p>

<p>
    Most importantly, if you end the task, your payment will correspond to the largest dollar amount in any of the boxes you have opened.
