  We will now proceed to Part 2 of the experiment.

  Recall that either Part 2 or Part 3 will be randomly chosen for payment.

<p>
  {{ if participant.valence == 'bonus' }}
  
  If Part 2 is chosen for payment, we will increase your balance by $0. In Part 2, you choose whether to open {{ C.NUM_FORCED_OPEN }} boxes and look for the highest bonus or accept some sure bonus and not open any boxes.


  {{ else}}
  
  If Part 2 is chosen for payment, we will increase your balance by ${{C.START_VALUE_PENALTY}}. In Part 2, you choose whether to open {{ C.NUM_FORCED_OPEN }} boxes and look for the lowest penalty or accept some sure penalty and not open any boxes.

   {{ endif }}
