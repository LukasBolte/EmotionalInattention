<p>
    We will now describe Part 3 of the experiment. 
</p>

<p>
    Recall that either Part 2 or Part 3 are randomly chosen to affect your balance. If Part 3 is randomly chosen for payment, you will receive an additional payment of ${{C.PAYMENT_PART_2}}. 
</p>
</p>
    In this part of the experiment, you only need to answer a few simple questions. Your additional payment from Part 3 will not be affected by your answers.
