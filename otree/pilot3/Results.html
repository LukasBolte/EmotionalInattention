    We have collected your answers and randomly chosen which part of the experiment will be used to determine your additional payment.
</p>





{{ if participant.part_payment == 'Part 2'}}

<p>
    After Part 1, your balance was {{ participant.payoff_after_part1|cu }}. <b>Part 2, and not Part 3, was randomly chosen to count</b>. This means that {{ if participant.valence == 'bonus'}}$0{{else}}${{C.START_VALUE_PENALTY}}{{endif}} is added to your current balance of {{ participant.payoff_after_part1|cu }}.
</p>

    <p>
        During Part 2, we asked you {{ C.LEN_BONUS_AMOUNTS }} questions, having you choose between completing the {{ C.NUM_FORCED_OPEN }}-box {{ participant.valence }} task OR accept some sure {{ participant.valence }} instead. The question randomly chosen: 
        </p>

    <p class="text-center">
        <i>
            {{ participant.question }}
        </i>
    </p>

    {{ if participant.collaborative_job }}
        <p>
            For this question, you chose <b>open {{ C.NUM_FORCED_OPEN }} boxes</b>. Thus you will next complete the {{ C.NUM_FORCED_OPEN }}-box {{ participant.valence }} task. Once you complete it, your balance will be updated depending on the final {{ participant.valence }} from the {{ C.NUM_FORCED_OPEN }}-box {{ participant.valence }}.
        </p>
        
    {{ else }}
        <p>
            For this question, you chose <b>{{ participant.right_option }}</b>. Thus, {{ participant.payment_text}}.
        </p>

    {{ endif }}

{{ else }}

<p>
    After Part 1, your balance was {{ participant.payoff_after_part1|cu }}. <b>Part 3, not Part 2, was randomly chosen to count</b>. This means that you will not complete the {{ C.NUM_FORCED_OPEN }}-box {{ participant.valence }} task. Instead, you will receive a payment of ${{C.PAYMENT_PART_2}} for completing Part 3 in addition to your current balance.
