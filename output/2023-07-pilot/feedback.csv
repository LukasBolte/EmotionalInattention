"The only thing I was confused about was how long I was supposed to continue.  I wasn't sure if the test would end on its own or I was just supposed to end it at a random interval.  I was a bit afraid I would go over the allotted time to take the study and it timed-out on me.  Time-outs mean no pay and I didn't want that to happen so I ended it before I really wanted to.  I'm patient, I could have did all 10,000.  LOL  well maybe not all 10K :)",bonus,4.32,3276.642783164978
