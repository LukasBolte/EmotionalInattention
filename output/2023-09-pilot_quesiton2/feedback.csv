595fdb459955ee00015bca16,I like the step by step approach with instructions that I can go back when I need it.,9.0,9.0,10.0,10.0,"('tasks', 'bonus', 'low')",8.11,28.4
62d811c885547ef37cb55d9b,The instructions for the first study were complicated.  The study was interesting because it really did force me to think about how the options would play out in study 1.,8.0,9.0,10.0,10.0,"('tasks', 'penalty', 'low')",3.0,13.6
55cf5cc434e9060005e56c39,"Where would the payment options happen, was that separate from the Part 1 and Part 2 ""games""? I thought when chosen for Part 1, previously there would have been a decision by me whether I would accept the collaborative job or not. I don't remember making this decision. The decision seemed to have been accepting a range of being paid or not being paid, for what - to take on the collaborative job? All I know is that I don't want to do the collaborative job (I don't want to click 100 times and it's unlikely to make any money with the collaborative job). If I don't want to do it would I have gotten the $8? It seems like it explicitly said yes but elsewhere was ambiguous. How would those option 1 and option 2 in the ranges, be applied - not in the original instructions. Would someone be presented with these different payments or charges if there were part 1 - would the computer pick one of them or how hypothetical was it? I honestly never want to do the collaborative job so at least picking (what I thought was) the range that would never have to do the collaborative job was as I understood it the appropriate answer, but I'm not used to not being able to picture what it is that I'm choosing from. Also - technically - the buttons were not very responsive. The button might highlight but not click. I was particularly concerned by the consent button. When I clicked the Yes button, it highlighted but didn't go anywhere, of course there was also a competing Next button so experimentally I clicked the next button and it went to the next screen. I spent the rest of the study wondering if I had successfully clicked the Yes button, because other buttons were also unresponsive (next buttons had to be clicked until they worked) or unintuitive -- if I was clicking the countdown button in order to open a box, why did the countdown button not respond in some way. I had to click the countdown buttons many many times (trying to get it to click before the end of the countdown) until I learned that apparently the button only needed to be clicked once but was just unresponsive as the countdown would continue. Assuming that is what happened - maybe the demo was all automatic and I didn't really need to be clicking at all. Also, I don't understand how the graph could end up with 10,000 boxes when the largest displayed number per dollar amount was in the hundreds. Each gradation by penny perhaps has a couple hundred but what does that even mean - how can I visualize gradation by penny. It felt like all the boxes weren't accounted for, which has something to do with how the gradation of the graph looked. Without studying all these things in depth I have no idea. Pay is good but it is always distressing to have larger sums dangled and unobtainable.",5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,"('tasks', 'bonus', 'low')",3.0,31.6
