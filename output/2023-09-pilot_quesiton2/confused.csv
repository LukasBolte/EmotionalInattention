55cf5cc434e9060005e56c39,1.0,Where is the payment for not doing the collaborative job coming from? Is it giving up the $8 from part 1 or not?  My decision was based on what is the benefit to me for clicking 100 times and unless there is a guaranteed benefit I don't want to click 100 times. The collaborative job seems like a loser whether you do the job or  not (the penalty is almost certainly more than the bonus). I can't keep track in my mind when I would be paying not to do the collaborative job (the confusion on the table).
