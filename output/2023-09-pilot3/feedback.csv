5ca95e5fb98ee20017d6eeb7,I understood the instructions. I would have opened more boxes in the first task however it takes time to view each one and their are less of the high ones.,10.0,10.0,10.0,9.0,"('tasks', 'bonus', 'low', 'original')",5.02,15.3

6319fe94b95ac2abc796fbe7,I really had fun with this survey I did not want to stop opening those boxes lol but did not want to run out of time to turn in the survey. You should give more surveys like this on prolific.,9.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,"('tasks', 'bonus', 'low', 'reversed')",9.9,50.6

5ea1ee658a9acd0eff894ae2,"I think the study was great. The instructions were very concise and not confusing at all. I really appreciate receiving any kind of bonus and that is what motivated me to keep opening boxes. I was concerned that I was going to run out of time so if not for that, I think that I would have continued with more boxes initially or I maybe would have answered questions differently during the 2nd task if I had been chosen for that.
