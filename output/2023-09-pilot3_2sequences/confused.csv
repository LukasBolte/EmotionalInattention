5ac5300f9534ba0001c7446b,1.0,The first page of part 2 instructions said it would increase my bonus by $0.  It was unclear if I could get any money at all from this stage.  I chose to operate under the assumption that I would be paid my bonus from this round if it was the one selected.

5ae74788d5ec5e000175ea08,1.0,"Actually I was confused about a page before this test, which said something about ""recall that there is a deficit of 10 dollars"" and asked me to guess something. I did not recall anything of that nature. Also, on this section it first said my bonus was zero, so I assumed that nothing I did would matter in this section."
